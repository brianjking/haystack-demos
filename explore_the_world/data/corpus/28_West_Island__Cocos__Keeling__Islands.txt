'''West Island''' (Malay: Pulau Panjang, Cocos Malay: Pulu Panjang), part of the South Keeling Islands, is the capital of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an Australian external territory in the Indian Ocean. The population is roughly 120 making it the third smallest capital in the world, and consists mainly of Europeans. It is less populous than Home Island, the only other inhabited island.

In November 2013 it was revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate operates a listening station on West Island.
